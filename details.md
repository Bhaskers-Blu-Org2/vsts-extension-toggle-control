## Customize your work item form with a toggle control ##

Represent your current boolean, binary string and binary integer fields with an easy-to-use toggle control on the work item form. 

You can customize the labels you would like to appear on your control. Additionally, the control can be used by both your mouse and keyboard (space bar, left and right arrow keys).

## Quick steps to get started ##

1. Navigate to your work item form customization page and choose which field (boolean, binary string or binary integer) you would like to replace with the toggle control.

2. Learn about how to customize the toggle control directly on XML [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-toggle-wit-custom-control/blob/master/README.md) for TFS.
